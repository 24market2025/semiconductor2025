These systems are essential for semiconductor industry sustainability efforts, protecting the environment and worker safety. The semiconductor abatement systems market is growing, with key factors such as market size, growth, and forecast for 2025 driving innovation in filtration and chemical scrubbing techniques. Manufacturers play a significant role in shaping the market share and price in regions like India.

A Brief Overview On Semiconductor Abatement Systems Market

The Global Semiconductor Abatement Systems Market was valued at US$ 849.9 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 1691.9 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 10.3% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

The semiconductor industry uses gases that are toxic, flammable and even harmful for the environment, but also for humans. For example, in the production of microchips. According to national legislation, these gases have to be abated. This means that they are reduced below the respective threshold limit value (TLV). Different gases require different treatment technologies, such as thermal, wet or even a combination of both technologies. The process exhaust gases can then be released into the atmosphere, without harming nature, for a greener world.
