<h1>Flexible PCB Cover Layer Market 2025-2032</h1>
Flexible PCB Cover Layer Market Overview
Flexible PCB Cover Layer consists of a solid sheet of polyimide with a layer of flexible adhesive. Coverlay plays the exact same function as a solder mask on rigid boards but only for flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs). Conventional solder masks have only a limited bendability, so for flex circuits that require greater bendability, coverlay is bonded (glued) on to encapsulate and protect the external copper circuit layers of a flexible printed circuit (FPC). Different from rigid PCB solder mask, coverlay is typically supplied in a roll form, sometimes in sheet and cut to size. From there, the coverlay openings needed may be drilled, routed, punched, or laser cut depending on the complexity of the flex PCB design and feature sizes. Once the pattern is created, the film is then aligned to the copper circuit layer and pressed under heat and pressure, over time, to cure the adhesive to complete the coverlay bonding.
