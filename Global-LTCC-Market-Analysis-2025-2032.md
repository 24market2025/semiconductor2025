➣ Global LTCC Market Overview

Low-Temperature Co-Fired Ceramic (LTCC) is a multilayer ceramic technology used to create compact, high-performance electronic components like substrates, modules, and packages. This technology enables the integration of passive components such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors into a single, miniaturized structure.

The LTCC manufacturing process involves several steps, including tape casting, screen printing, stacking, lamination, and co-firing at temperatures between 850°C to 1000°C. The use of lower sintering temperatures allows for the incorporation of conductive materials like silver, gold, and copper, which are essential for advanced electronic designs. LTCC is known for its unique characteristics, such as its ability to support multilayer stacking, high thermal conductivity, low dielectric loss at high frequencies, and excellent thermal stability.

Global LTCC Market was estimated to be worth USD 1616.02 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 1971.58 million at a CAGR of 3.37% from 2024 to 2030
