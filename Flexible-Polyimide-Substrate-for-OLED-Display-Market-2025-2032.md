<h1>Flexible Polyimide Substrate for OLED Display Market</h1>
Flexible Polyimide Substrate for OLED Display Market Overview
Flexible OLED display uses flexible PI (polyimide) film as the substrate, while glass substrate is used as the carrier. Therefore, laser stripping (LLO) has become one of the key technologies in the production of flexible OLED screen, aiming at stripping PI film from glass carrier as the substrate. Manufacturing flexible display screen has multiple processes, PI varnish is applied in the bottom layer, covering the glass plate, and then superimposed on the thin film transistor (TFT) luminescent material, through high temperature evaporation, deposition, annealing and other processing, laser peel into a film. There are two kinds of PI varnish on the market, one is yellow PI varnish, and another is transparent PI varnish. Among them, yellow PI varnish is mostly used as the substrate of OLED LCD screen; Transparent PI varnish is mainly used as cover plate and touch material of folding screen, such as cover plate of foldable electronic paper display module, etc. In this report, our statistic object is yellow PI varnish.
