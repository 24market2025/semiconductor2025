<h1>GaN Bare-die Market</h1>
GaN Bare-die Market Overview
Gallium nitride (GaN) transistors offer fundamental advantages over silicon. In particular, the higher critical electrical field makes it very attractive for power semiconductor devices with outstanding specific dynamic on-state resistance and smaller capacitances compared to silicon MOSFETs, which makes GaN HEMTs great for high speed switching applications. Gallium nitride transistors can then be operated with reduced dead-times which results in higher efficiency and enables passive cooling. Operation at high switching frequencies allows the volume of passive components to shrink which improves GaN HEMTs reliability and overall power density.

This report provides a deep insight into the global GaN Bare-die market covering all its essential aspects. This ranges from a macro overview of the market to micro details of the market size, competitive landscape, development trend, niche market, key market drivers and challenges, SWOT analysis, value chain analysis, etc.
