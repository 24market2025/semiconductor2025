➣ Global MicroLED Market Overview

Micro-LED, also known as microLED, mLED or LED, is an emerging flat panel display technology. Micro-LED displays consist of arrays of microscopic LEDs forming the individual pixel elements. When compared to the widespread LCD technology, Micro-LED displays offer better contrast, response times, and energy efficiency.

MicroLED, which stands for Micro Light-Emitting Diode, represents a cutting-edge display technology that harnesses an array of microscopic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to generate images and visuals. These tiny LEDs are considerably smaller than conventional ones, measuring just a few micrometers in size.

MicroLED displays present numerous advantages compared to other display technologies like LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) and OLED (Organic Light-Emitting Diode). They excel in brightness, contrast ratio, and color reproduction, resulting in exceptionally vivid and lifelike images. Moreover, MicroLED screens operate without the need for a backlight, making them highly energy-efficient and capable of achieving true blacks by individually controlling the light emission of each pixel.
