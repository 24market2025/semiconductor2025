âž£ Market Growth

The global Microchannel Cooler market was valued at US$ 114.6 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 225.4 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 10.1% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Micro-channel cooling is commonly achieved with the aid of a heat sink consisting of a high conductivity substrate that contains a large number of parallel, small diameter channels. These heat sinks are very compact and lightweight, and by allowing the coolant to undergo phase change (boiling) along the channels, they provide heat transfer coefficients far greater than those possible with single-phase liquid counterparts.
