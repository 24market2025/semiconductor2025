<h1>Guided Wave Radar Level Transmitter Market</h1>
Guided Wave Radar Level Transmitter Market Overview
Guided wave radar level transmitter is a liquid level measuring instrument in the chemical industry. Guided wave radar level gauge is a level gauge based on the principle of time domain reflection (TDR). The electromagnetic pulse of the radar level gauge propagates along the steel cable or probe at the speed of light. When it hits the surface of the measured medium, Part of the pulse of the radar level gauge is reflected to form an echo and returns to the pulse transmitting device along the same path. The distance between the transmitting device and the surface of the measured medium is proportional to the propagation time of the pulse. After calculation, the liquid level height is finally obtained.
