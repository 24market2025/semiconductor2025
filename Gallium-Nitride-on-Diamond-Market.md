<h1>Gallium Nitride on Diamond Market</h1>
Gallium Nitride on Diamond Market Overview
Gallium nitride-on-Diamond technology is a pioneering materials invention from Akash co-founder, Felix Ejeckam that is created by lifting GaN thin films from its original growth substrate and transferring it to a synthetic CVD diamond substrate which, at 1,600-2,000 W/mK, exhibits the highest known thermal conductivity (4+ times higher than the next best materials) ever manufactured. Bringing together the GaN thin films Â– the core materials used for satellite communications equipment, and synthetic CVD diamond, enables an unprecedented tens of Kilowatt densities of heat to be extracted more efficiently and effectively than ever before. GaN-on-Diamond based satellites opens the world of ubiquitous, low-cost, and ultra-high data rate communications never before imagined.
