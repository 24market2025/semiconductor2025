<h1>Fabless IC Design Market</h1>
Fabless IC Design Market Overview
Fabless IC design refers to fabless integrated circuit design. It is a business model in which companies focus on integrated circuit design and development without their own wafer manufacturing plants. Under this model, IC design companies usually only engage in the design and sales of semiconductors, while entrusting chip manufacturing, packaging and testing to chip foundry companies. Companies that adopt the Fabless model can focus on the design and sales of semiconductors.

This allows these companies to not only concentrate resources to continue technological innovation and upgrading, but also to independently select advanced process technologies and enter into long-term strategic cooperation with top-ranked chip foundries, thereby making full use of the world's advanced process manufacturing technologies and mature quality management. system. In addition, under the Fabless model, the company will have high market sensitivity, quickly respond to market hot spots and demand changes, quickly launch new products, and focus on improving market development and customer maintenance capabilities. In terms of cost, the Fabless model has a relatively smaller initial capital investment compared to the IDM model. It can give full play to its R&D strength and market development capabilities and quickly achieve large-scale benefits. This report focuses on fabless IC design, including the Analog ICs, Logic ICs, Microcontroller and Microprocessor ICs and Memory ICs.
