<h1>Handset Flash LED Modules Market 2025-2032</h1>
Handset Flash LED Modules Market Overview
Handsets consist of two types of photo flash LEDs, namely xenon flash and white LEDs. Xenon flash is used in both film and standalone digital cameras. White LED illumination is mostly used in camera phones. LEDs are faster than xenon flash and also enable flash lighting in the video mode, which is not possible with xenon flash. Flash LEDs are brighter and provide two types of lighting: blue LED and white LED. Both these lightings use Indium Gallium Nitride (InGaN). In flash applications, LEDs operate on a pulse current, which is a brief burst of direct current (DC).
