<h1>Global Active Phased Array TR Module Market 2025-2032</h1>
Active Phased Array TR Module Market Overview

T/R module is a functional module used in radar or communication systems to receive and transmit electromagnetic wave signals of a certain frequency, and to perform amplitude and phase control within the working bandwidth. It is an active phased array radar that implements beam electronic control scanning, signal transmission and reception. The core component of amplification is the core of phased array radar and accounts for a high proportion of the cost of phased array radar. It is mainly used to amplify transmitting and receiving signals, as well as control signal amplitude and phase. The T/R module consists of a low-noise amplifier, a power amplifier, a limiter, a phase shifter, etc., and is widely used in precision guidance and radar detection and other fields.
