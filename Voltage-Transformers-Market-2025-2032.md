➣ Global Voltage Transformers Market Overview

Voltage transformers, also known as potential transformers (PTs), are essential components in electrical power systems, designed to step down high voltages to safer, measurable levels for monitoring, control, and protection purposes. By providing an accurate scaled-down representation of the system voltage, they ensure the safe and efficient operation of equipment such as meters, relays, and other monitoring devices.

Voltage transformers operate on the principle of electromagnetic induction and are typically classified into two types: electromagnetic voltage transformers (EMVTs) and capacitive voltage transformers (CVTs), each suited for specific applications. Their robust design ensures precision and reliability, making them indispensable in the semiconductor industry and modern power distribution and transmission networks.
