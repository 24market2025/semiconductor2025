<h1>Fused Silica Optical Components Market</h1>
Fused Silica Optical Components Market Overview
Fused Silica is a non-crystalline (glass) form of silicon dioxide (quartz, sand). It lacks long range order in its atomic structure. Its highly cross-linked three-dimensional structure gives it a high using temperature and low thermal expansion coefficient. In optics, fused silica glass has a high transmittance from ultraviolet to near-infrared (185nm-00nm). Coupled with low refractive index variations, it exhibits ideal optical qualities for high-precision optics applications. In addition, the physical properties of fused silica glass make it particularly useful for high-performance applications in harsh conditions. This report mainly focuses fused silica optical components market.
