<h1>Global Fiber Optical Attenuators Market</h1>
Fiber Optical Attenuators Market Overview

Optical Variable Attenuators or Variable Optical Attenuators (VOAs) is a type of optical attenuator, a device used to reduce the power level of an optical signal, either in free space or in an optical fiber. Attenuators may use the Gap-Loss , Absorptive , or Reflective technique to achieve the desired signal loss. Variable optical attenuator is general used for testing and measurement, but it is also has a wide usage in EDFAs for equalizing the light power among different channels.
