<h1>Power Module Substrates Market 2025-2032</h1>
Power Module Substrates Market Overview
This report studies the ceramic substrates used in power modules. The key ceramic substrates are DBC substrates and AMB substrates. The power modules include IGBT modules and SiC modules. DBC (Direct Bonded Copper) substrates are composed of a ceramic insulator, Al2O3 or AlN onto which pure copper metal is attached by a high temperature eutectic melting process and thus tightly and firmly joined to the ceramic.

Active Metal Brazing (AMB) is the latest developments in ceramic substrates and offers the ability to produce Heavy Copper with a AlN (Aluminium Nitride) or SiN (Silicon Nitride). The normal metallisation process is not used as AMB involves brazing pure copper on the ceramic in a high temperature vacuum brazing process. As well as offering a high reliability substrate with unique heat dissipation. The brazing technology also enables double sided copper weights of up to 800Î¼m on thin ceramic substrates of just 0.25mm.

This report provides a deep insight into the global Power Module Substrates market covering all its essential aspects. This ranges from a macro overview of the market to micro details of the market size, competitive landscape, development trend, niche market, key market drivers and challenges, SWOT analysis, value chain analysis, etc.
